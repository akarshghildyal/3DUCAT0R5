# Introduction
### Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice
In the rapidly evolving world of technology education, a significant challenge persists: the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Students often find themselves equipped with the principles but lacking the confidence and hands-on experience needed to navigate the complexities of real-world technology. This is especially true in the realm of hardware learning, where abstract concepts meet tangible applications. Traditional educational resources, while valuable, sometimes fall short in preparing students for the hands-on challenges they face.

Enter SkillUP, an innovative edtech platform designed to transform the way students and educators approach hardware technology learning. Our mission is to empower learners by bridging the theoretical and practical divide through immersive, interactive learning experiences. By leveraging the power of Augmented Reality (AR) and the intelligence of AI chatbots, including integrations with Gemini and Wolfram Alpha, SkillUP brings hardware models to life, making complex concepts accessible and engaging.

### The Solution: A Hands-On Learning Experience
SkillUP introduces students to a world where learning is not just about observing but interacting. Imagine having the ability to explore a 3D model of an Arduino board in AR, understanding its components and functions with the tap of a finger, and receiving real-time guidance from AI-powered chatbots. This is the immersive learning environment SkillUP provides.

For educators, SkillUP offers a robust analytics dashboard that sheds light on student engagement, highlights areas of interest, and identifies common queries. This insight enables educators to tailor their teaching methods, focusing on topics that require further explanation and enriching the classroom experience with data-driven insights.

By seamlessly integrating AR technology with AI-driven support, SkillUP not only enhances the learning experience but also equips students with the confidence and knowledge to excel in practical applications. Welcome to the future of hardware technology education, where theoretical knowledge meets practical experience in an immersive, interactive platform.

# Target Entities
### Schools
This can be implemented in Science Labs, to give an introduction to the practical approach without utilization of large extent of resources.
### Colleges
This can be implemented in tech events, labs, technical clubs, and can be used by an individual student to learn and understand with an immersive eperience.
### Teaching Professionals
Teaching Professionals can use this to manage their students and check upon required assignments which are assigned by the faculty, the faculty can check upon most asked questions by the students
### Professional Organisations
Professional organisation can use the software to technically train GETs to explain them their complex hardware and it can be used to remote assistance to for immediate repairing

# Challenges Faced
### Implementing interactive augmented reality models:
With the idea in place, in our first review we were suggested to work more to make the 3D models interactive and with some precision. We then finalised to use AdobeAero to have triggers for the other animations to load up.

### Creating and Retrieving individual .glb files of components:
To custom make some models since the components are not readily available or are not available in the required format. Rendering the models was time consuming. Used Blender to design the models and used Adobe Aero to implement the ultrasonic sensor. In the same way we can implement other sensors to react with the environmnet with the particular functionality.

### Specialised Chat Bot:
We used Gemini to implement our AI Chatbot and then we further specialized it to answer questions related to the particular required subject. For example as we trained it for 'hardware knowledge related to electronics and microcontrollers', in the same way it can be optimised for any such required subject.

### Making a website with multiple required sections:
Making an interactive dashboard for the faculty side and the student side, integrating .glb files, providing individual qr codes in the website for AR feature, section for chatbot which helps clearing doubts and helps doing circuit design.

# Future Improvements
- Improving UI
- Improving the faculty side of the website
- Adding more models
- Add a section to learn with a roadmap
- Expanding into an application
- Find if a better method of implementing interaction with Augmented Reality

# Financial Model
- We provide link of components used in the project and charge the particular company/business for the feature on our website.
- We can sell the software to technical organisations, so that they can optimise and modify it according to themselves and perform simulations on their hardware products.
